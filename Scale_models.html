  POLIGONAL PAVILION

  <p>
    FOR THE FIRST SCALED MODEL OF THE
    YEAR, BETWEEN GROUPS OF THREE
    WE WERE ASSIGNED THE TASK TO
    CREATE A SELF SUSTAINING PAVILION.
    THE MAIN DIFFICULTY OF THIS WOULD
    LIE IN THE FACT THAT IT HAD TO ACT
    AS A SHELTER, SO IT SHOULD BE
    DESIGNED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF IT
    BEING A CLOSED STRUCTURE.

  ANOTHER
  REQUISITE WAS THAT IT COULD ONLY
  BE MADE OUT OF REGULAR POLYGONS.
  THE RECURRING DESIRE TO CREATE
  EXPERIMENTAL ARCHITECTURE,IS REFLECTED HERE WITH
  THE USE OF THE TRIANGLE NOT AS AN
  ELEMENT THAT INTERCONNECTS WITH
  ITSELF LIKE PATCHWORK, BUT RATHER
  THERE IS A FOCUS ON EXPLORING
  THE TEXTURES AND VOLUME THAT
  COULD ARISE BY LAYERING THE
  SAME SHAPE ONTO AND AROUND
  EACH MANY VERSIONS OF ITSELF

PAVILION DER LICHTER
</p>
<p>
  THIS 1/20 SCALE MODEL HAS BEEN DESIGNED
UNDER THE OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT TO
CREATE A PAVILION WITH A SOLID FUNCTION
THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE BROUGHT TO LIFE. THE
OBJECTIVE CHOSEN IN THIS CASE WAS TO CREATE
A READING SPACE, THE AMBIANCE OF WHICH HAS
PLACED AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE DESIGN
PROCESS, THE REASON WHY DIM LIGHT SEEPS IN
THROUGH THE INTERSTITIAL SPACES BETWEEN
THE NUMEROUS UNDULATING CARDBOARD
SHEETS.

 SPACES LOCATED TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF
 THE INTERIOR'S FAR END, PROVIDING PRIVACY

    IN A PERIOD OF THREE HOURS WE WERE ASKED TO STUDY THE PENGUIN
  SWIMMING POOL IN LONDON ZOO BY LUBETKIN AND PROCEED TO MAKE A
  1/100 SCALED MODEL OF IT. THE ONE IN HAND UNDERLINES ITS HIGHLIGHTS,
