    Ã˜STFOLD MUSEUM BENCH
    </p>
    <p>
      THE OBJECTIVE HERE WAS TO DESIGN A BENCH USING THE SWEEP COMMANDS ON
RHINO, MEANING THAT THE SEATING AREA HAD TO BE SHAPED OUT OF SURFACES
CREATED BY A SERIES OF CURVES AND A LINE THAT LINKS THEM TOGETHER. THE FINAL
PRODUCT WOULD HAVE TO GATHER ALL INFORMATION NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THIS
STRUCTURE AND ORGANISE IT INTO A BRIEF PAMPHLET, THE COVER FOR WHICH ARE THE
TWO IMAGES SHOWN UP TOP. FURTHERMORE, WE WERE ADVISED TO CONTEXTUALISE
IT AS WE LIKED, WHICH EXPLAINS THE TITLE, LINKING IT TO MUSEUM IN NORWAY.
